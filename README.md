# Economic Analysis Repository

## Overview
This repository contains data, code, analysis, and documentation related to economic research conducted on the determinants of GDP growth. The research aims to explore the influence of various economic factors on GDP dynamics, employing statistical techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis.

## Contents
- **Data:** The repository includes datasets containing economic indicators, GDP figures, and relevant variables for the analysis.
- **Code:** Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks are provided to conduct data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and DiD analysis.
- **Analysis:** Detailed documentation and reports summarizing the findings, interpretations, and insights derived from the analysis.
- **Reports:**
  - **Research Report (PDF):** A comprehensive report articulating the research methodology, findings, and conclusions in detail.
  - **Poster Presentation (PDF):** A visually summarized poster presenting key insights and results from the analysis for quick reference.
- **README:** This README file provides an overview of the repository contents, project objectives, and instructions for usage.

## Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are to:
- Identify and analyze the key determinants of GDP growth in a specified context.
- Evaluate the impact of specific economic policies, interventions, or events on GDP dynamics.
- Provide insights and recommendations for policymakers, economists, and stakeholders based on empirical evidence and analysis results.

## Methodology
The analysis employs a combination of statistical techniques, including OLS regression and DiD analysis, to investigate the relationship between economic variables and GDP growth. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation are conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of the analysis.
